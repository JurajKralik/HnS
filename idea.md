# Pillars of Design
Horror, Zombie apocalypse, Hack and Slash

# Gameplay Loop
The player is trying to survive as long as possible whilst trying to kill as many zombies as possible. 
The player can use a gun that has 12 bullets and needs to be reloaded frequently. 
Manual reloading will save time. 
There are also health packs in case of injury. 
Zombie hordes will come for the player faster and faster, creating the challenge.

# Controls
- W, A, S, D for movement
- R for reload
- Point the cursor to aim
- Left click to shoot

# Enemies
Zombies. 
Each should be affected by a little randomness (health pack spawn chance, damage received, damage done, growling sounds).
They should attack the player face-to-face and avoid collision.

# Art and Sound
- Art should feel cartoonish but dark.
- Sound should be as authentic as possible. Growling of zombies, effects of gun, background sounds indicating late night.
